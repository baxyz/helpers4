# DevContainer Data Directory

This directory stores persistent devcontainer data to maintain your development environment across container rebuilds.

## Contents

- `zsh_history` - Command history persistence for zsh shell
- `gitconfig` - Git configuration persistence
- `ssh/` - SSH keys and configuration for Git authentication
- `gnupg/` - GPG keys for commit signing

## Purpose

When working with devcontainers, your shell history, Git configuration, SSH keys, and GPG keys are typically lost when the container is rebuilt. This directory ensures these important development artifacts persist between container sessions.

## Security Note

This directory contains sensitive authentication data (SSH and GPG keys). Ensure it's properly excluded from version control via .gitignore if you don't want to commit these files.
