# TODO List - Helpers4 Main Library

This file contains tasks and prompts for GitHub Copilot to help continue development of the Helpers4 library.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. üîÑ Complete Build System Enhancement
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Help me enhance the build system in scripts/build/ to better handle TypeScript compilation and package generation. The system should:
- Generate proper .d.ts files for each helper function
- Create individual package.json files for each category
- Ensure tree-shaking compatibility
- Validate all exports are properly typed
- Support both ESM and CommonJS outputs

Context: The current build system works but needs optimization for better TypeScript support and bundle analysis.
```

### 2. üìä Performance Benchmarking
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create a comprehensive benchmarking system for Helpers4 functions. I need:
- Performance tests for all array, object, and function helpers
- Comparison with lodash, ramda, and radashi equivalents
- Memory usage analysis
- Bundle size impact measurement
- Automated performance regression detection

The benchmark results should be integrated into the documentation website and CI pipeline.
```

### 3. üß™ Test Coverage Enhancement
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Analyze the current test coverage and help me create comprehensive tests for edge cases. Focus on:
- Error handling scenarios
- Type safety validation
- Performance edge cases
- Browser compatibility
- Node.js compatibility
- Memory leak detection

Current test files are in helpers/*/test.ts - review and suggest improvements.
```

### 4. üîê Security Audit
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Help me implement security best practices for the Helpers4 library:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Safe eval alternatives for dynamic code
- Input sanitization patterns
- Security testing automation
- Documentation for secure usage patterns

Focus on functions that handle user input or dynamic operations.
```

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 5. üìö API Documentation Generation
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create an automated system to generate API documentation from TSDoc comments. The system should:
- Extract function signatures and descriptions
- Generate markdown files for the documentation website
- Include usage examples from test files
- Cross-reference related functions
- Validate documentation completeness

This should integrate with the helpers4/doc project and update automatically.
```

### 6. üîÑ Migration Tools
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create migration tools and codemods to help users migrate from other utility libraries to Helpers4:
- Lodash to Helpers4 migration
- Ramda to Helpers4 migration
- Custom migration patterns
- Automated import rewriting
- Breaking change detection

Include CLI tools and VS Code extensions if possible.
```

### 7. üéØ Bundle Size Optimization
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Help me optimize the bundle size and tree-shaking capabilities:
- Analyze current bundle impact
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Implement better tree-shaking markers
- Create bundle size monitoring
- Optimize dependency usage
- Add bundle analysis to CI

Compare results with major utility libraries.
```

### 8. üîå Plugin System
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Design and implement a plugin system for Helpers4 that allows:
- Custom helper registration
- Third-party helper integration
- Type-safe plugin APIs
- Runtime helper loading
- Plugin validation and testing
- Community plugin ecosystem

This should maintain type safety and tree-shaking benefits.
```

## Low Priority Tasks

### 9. üåê Internationalization
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Add internationalization support for string helpers and error messages:
- Locale-aware string processing
- Date formatting helpers
- Number formatting utilities
- Error message localization
- Multi-language documentation
- Cultural adaptation patterns

Keep the core library lightweight while supporting i18n scenarios.
```

### 10. üé® Code Generation Tools
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create tools to generate helper functions from specifications:
- Function template generator
- Test case generator
- Documentation generator
- Type definition generator
- Validation schema generator

This should help with consistent code patterns and rapid development.
```

### 11. üì± Framework Integrations
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create framework-specific integrations and utilities:
- React hooks for common patterns
- Vue composables
- Angular services
- Svelte actions
- Framework-agnostic patterns

Maintain separation of concerns and optional dependencies.
```

### 12. üîç Developer Tools
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create developer tools to enhance the Helpers4 development experience:
- VS Code extension with helper suggestions
- Browser devtools extension
- CLI tools for project analysis
- Code linting rules
- Debugging utilities

Focus on improving developer productivity and code quality.
```

## Ongoing Maintenance

### üîÑ Regular Tasks
**Prompts for regular maintenance:**

1. **Dependency Updates:**
   ```
   Help me update dependencies while maintaining compatibility. Analyze the impact of each update and suggest migration strategies if needed.
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   ```
   Review performance metrics and identify any regressions. Suggest optimizations based on real-world usage patterns.
   ```

3. **Community Feedback:**
   ```
   Analyze GitHub issues and discussions to identify feature requests and pain points. Prioritize improvements based on community needs.
   ```

4. **Documentation Updates:**
   ```
   Keep documentation synchronized with code changes. Ensure examples are current and best practices are reflected.
   ```

## Integration with Documentation Project

### Documentation Sync
**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Help me maintain synchronization between this library and the helpers4/doc documentation project:
- Auto-generate API reference from source code
- Sync version releases with documentation updates
- Ensure examples in docs match current API
- Update migration guides when APIs change
- Coordinate release notes and changelog

The documentation project uses Docusaurus and should automatically reflect changes here.
```

### Cross-Project Workflow
**Context for documentation project integration:**
- Documentation repository: helpers4/doc
- Auto-trigger on releases via GitHub Actions
- Version management coordination
- Content generation from source code
- Example synchronization

## Usage Examples for Copilot

When working on specific areas, provide this context:

### For Array Helpers:
```
I'm working on array helper functions in helpers/array/. These should be:
- Highly performant for large datasets
- Tree-shakable and independently importable
- Type-safe with proper generics
- Compatible with both native arrays and array-like objects
- Thoroughly tested including edge cases
```

### For Function Helpers:
```
I'm working on function utilities in helpers/function/. Focus on:
- Debouncing and throttling with proper cleanup
- Memoization with memory management
- Type-safe function composition
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization for high-frequency usage
```

### For Build System:
```
I'm working on the build system in scripts/build/. This system:
- Generates individual npm packages from a monorepo structure
- Creates TypeScript definitions
- Ensures tree-shaking compatibility
- Validates package integrity
- Supports both development and production builds
```

Remember to always consider:
- **Type Safety**: All code should be strictly typed
- **Performance**: Optimize for real-world usage scenarios
- **Tree-shaking**: Ensure minimal bundle impact
- **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with implementation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
- **Compatibility**: Support modern environments while maintaining broad compatibility
